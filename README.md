# CredPouch
Create, manage, store, and share IDs and Payment Information in a self-sovereign, decentralized and open way

## Introduction

CredPouch is inspired by my desire to build an open, flexible, extensible, and easy way for anyone to create, manage, store, and share their ID details and payment information using open-source technology in a self-sovereign way

With CredPouch, my goal is to build something that meets the following needs

### As a CredPouch Contributor
- [ ] I want to contribute new CredInfo (IDs, and Payment types/methods/formats) to CredPouch

### As a Open-source/App Developer
- [ ] I want to deploy CredPouch to a server to create, manage, store, and share my own CredInfo
- [ ] I want to build an App using CredPouch that I can offer to my users to create, manage, store, and share their own CredInfo
- [ ] I want to get formatted and code-friendly CredPouch object by calling a CredLink (A link representing the content of a CredPouch)

### As a User
- [ ] I want to get my shareable CredLink which contains all ID and Payment information
- [ ] I want to get a shareable CredLink which contains select ID and Payment information
- [ ] I want to create, manage, store, and share my own CredInfo via an interface/app hosted by a Developer
- [ ] I want to enable some authentication/code verification for my CredLink or any of my shareable CredLinks 

### As a Platform/App/Entity
- [ ] I want to accept a User's CredLink and properly decipher the type and content of their ID and Payment Information and use it for Payment, Account creation, Authentication, Authorization etc
- [ ] I want to issue new CredInfo that can be stored in a user's CredPouch after the user's authorization
